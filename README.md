# EduAlert-System

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
EduAlert-System is an AI-powered early warning system for identifying students at risk of dropping out of school, combining predictive analytics with real-time intervention strategies. The system helps educators and administrators take proactive measures to support students before academic or attendance issues become critical.

## Background

The project addresses these key problems:
* High school dropout rates globally
* Late intervention in student academic struggles
* Limited resources for student monitoring
* Lack of data-driven decision making in education

Personal motivation: Creating an accessible tool that helps ensure every student has the support they need to succeed in education, particularly in underserved communities.

## How is it used?

The implementation follows a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Regional Pilot (3-6 months)
* Selection of pilot region based on specific criteria
* System setup and integration with existing school databases
* Training of staff and administrators
* Initial data collection and analysis

### Phase 2: Data Collection & Analysis
* Student attendance tracking
* Academic performance monitoring
* Behavioral pattern analysis
* Integration with existing school management systems

### Phase 3: AI Implementation
* Predictive modeling for dropout risk
* Real-time alert system
* Automated intervention recommendations
* Performance analytics dashboard

## Data sources and AI methods
* School attendance records
* Academic performance data
* Behavioral incident reports
* Socioeconomic indicators
* Machine Learning methods: Random Forest, Neural Networks for prediction
* Natural Language Processing for analyzing student feedback

## Challenges
* Data privacy and security concerns
* Need for consistent data collection across different schools
* Varying technical infrastructure in different regions
* Potential bias in AI models
* Resource constraints in implementing interventions

## What next?
* Expand to additional regions
* Develop mobile application
* Integrate additional data sources
* Create multilingual support
* Build community support networks

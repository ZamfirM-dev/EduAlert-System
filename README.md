# EduAlert-System

**Final project for the Building AI course**

## Summary

**EduAlert-System** is an AI-powered early warning system designed to identify students at risk of dropping out of school. Combining predictive analytics with real-time intervention strategies, the system helps educators and administrators take proactive measures to support students before academic or attendance issues become critical.

## Background

The project addresses the following key issues:

- High global school dropout rates
- Late intervention in students' academic struggles
- Limited resources for student monitoring
- Lack of data-driven decision-making in education

**Personal Motivation:**  
According to the latest UNESCO data, there are 250 million children worldwide who are out of school, with many lacking the support and resources they need to succeed in education. This data highlights the urgency of creating accessible, AI-driven tools like EduAlert-System. The system aims to prevent dropout rates and improve retention by providing educational institutions, especially those in underserved regions, with the capability to monitor and intervene effectively. My goal is to ensure that every student has access to the support they need, regardless of socioeconomic challenges, fostering educational success in communities where it's needed the most.

## How is it used?

Implementation follows a phased approach:

**Phase 1: Regional Pilot (3-6 months)**

- Selection of a pilot region based on specific criteria
- System setup and integration with existing school databases
- Training of staff and administrators
- Initial data collection and analysis

**Phase 2: Data Collection & Analysis**

- Student attendance tracking
- Academic performance monitoring
- Behavioral pattern analysis
- Integration with existing school management systems

**Phase 3: AI Implementation**

- Predictive modeling for dropout risk
- Real-time alert system
- Automated intervention recommendations
- Performance analytics dashboard

## Data Sources and AI Methods

- **Data Sources:**
  - School attendance records
  - Academic performance data
  - Behavioral incident reports
  - Socioeconomic indicators

- **AI Methods:**
  - Machine Learning: Random Forest, Neural Networks for prediction
  - Natural Language Processing for analyzing student feedback

## Challenges

- Data privacy and security concerns
- Need for consistent data collection across different schools
- Varying technical infrastructure in different regions
- Potential bias in AI models
- Resource constraints in implementing interventions

## What's Next?

- Expansion to additional regions
- Development of a mobile application
- Integration of additional data sources
- Creation of multilingual support
- Building community support networks
